# Codex Instructions — Maestro Carpintero

You are working on a deterministic, rule-based Plan Engine.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT invent folders or files.
- Do NOT change existing architecture without explicit instruction.
- Do NOT introduce AI, ML, or heuristics.
- Respect domain-only boundaries.
- Operations are atomic and have no UI, steps, or persistence knowledge.

Workflow rules:
- Ask before creating new files.
- Always reference existing types before adding new ones.
- Prefer minimal changes over abstractions.

If unsure, stop and ask.
